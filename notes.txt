Notes on how we detect cartridge types.

DPC:
Detect via RNG

CV:
Detect via write port at 1700

E7:
Detect via bankswitch at 1fe4 and 1fe5 and then compare 1200-17F0.
Then check how many banks are available via CRCs.
Switchable write port 1000-13ff, read port 1400-17ff.
Permanent write port 1800-18ff, read port 1900-19ff.
Hotspots 1fe0-1feb

3F:
Detect via bankswitch at 3F and then compare 1200-17EF

UA:
Switch banks via hotspots at 0220/0240 and then compare 1200-17EF

FE:
Switch banks via control at 01FE and then compare 1200-17EF

E0:
Switch 1800-1BFF bank using hotspots 1FF0 and 1FF1 and then compare 1A00-1BFF
Hotspots 1FE0-1FF7

F4
Switch banks via 1FF4 and 1FFB and then compare 1200-1FEF
Hotspots 1FF4-1FFB

Superchip variant: Detect write port at 1000
Write port 1000-107F, read port 1080-10FF

F6
Switch banks via 1FF6 and 1FF7 and then compare 1200-1FEF
Hotspots 1FF6-1FF9

F8
Switch banks via 1FF8 and 1FF9 and then compare 1200-1FEF
Hotspots 1FF8-1FF9

FA
Should first look for write port at 1000, but don't yet.
Then as a double-check switch banks via 1FF9 and 1FFA with D0 asserted and then compare 1200-1FEF
Hotspots 1FF9-1FFB with D0 asserted
Write port 1000-10FF, read port 1100-11FF
